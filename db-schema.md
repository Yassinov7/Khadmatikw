# üöÄ Redesign Recommendations
1. **Remove direct price attributes** (`price`, `sale_price`, `discount_percent`) to make the schema more flexible and SEO-friendly.  
2. **Add slug fields** for SEO-friendly URLs in `blog_posts`, `categories`, `products`, and `offers`.  
3. **Redesign offers** to highlight features like:
   - Marketing headline
   - Benefits or USP (Unique Selling Proposition)
   - Validity dates
   - Media assets (images, banners)
   - Contact channels  

This structure avoids price sensitivity while still supporting attractive promotional content.
