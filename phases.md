Phases of deleopment 
phase 1: 
I have a website with:
- Static pages.
- Dynamic pages from Supabase (products + categories + one article).
Create a step-by-step plan to improve SEO:
1. Implement clean, SEO-friendly URLs.
2. Optimize Title, Meta, Open Graph, and Alt tags.
3. Add Structured Data (schema.org) for products and articles.
4. Ensure Supabase dynamic content is crawlable and indexable by search engines.
5. Suggest a blog/article content strategy to improve organic traffic.
phase 2: 
There was an old offers table that got removed.  
I want to redesign the Offers section with:
1. A modern, attractive layout without showing direct prices.
2. A new data structure in Supabase for storing offers.
3. Full CRUD management from the Admin Dashboard.
4. SEO-friendly implementation (structured data + headings).
phase 3:
I have a basic Admin Dashboard.  
Upgrade it to a modern and interactive UI with:
1. A clean design (React + Tailwind or ShadCN).
2. Advanced filtering for products and categories.
3. Management for the new Offers system (add/edit/remove).
4. A flexible Articles management system with SEO fields (Meta + Slug).
5. Role-based access control (Admin, Editor).
phase 4:
I want to add internal analytics.  
Requirements:
1. Track page visits (Page Views).
2. Track product and category clicks.
3. Measure conversion rate (visit â†’ click).
4. Store analytics data in Supabase with structured tables.
5. Display statistics and charts inside the Admin Dashboard.
phase 5: 
Design a roadmap for a stronger website version.  
Include:
1. Improved SEO and UX best practices.
2. Updated modern and professional design.
3. Integrated analytics dashboard for tracking.
4. Future features to increase engagement:
   - Wishlist (favorite products).
   - Notifications system.
   - Personalized content per user interests.
   - Product rating/reviews.
